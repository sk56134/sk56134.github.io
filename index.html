        <h2> Kuchipudi </h2>
        The first hobby that I have is dancing. I have loved dancing ever since I was a kid, and there are many stories of me going off by myself, turning on the stereo and chorepgraphing random dance routines when I was growing up. Recognizing this, my parents signed me up for a dance lessons in a classical indain dance form called Kuchipudi. The rest is histroy, I started when I was 4 years old and I continue practing and putting on shows to this day. In 2015, I even had a rangapravesam (often also called an Arangetram) which is a big deal in the dance world. It signifies the dancer's completion of training and readiness to enter the stage as a fully trained performer. Here a few pictures of that day:

         A big reason for Kuchipudi being adored world wide is the ability to capture many emotions and display beautiful stories through dahce.
