	      <p> Hello! Welcome to my web project for CSCI 1100! For my webpage, I will be using this page to talk about a two of my favorite hobbies.
          Hope you enjoy getting to know me a little better!
		    </p>
        <h2 style="color:maroon;"> Kuchipudi </h2>
	    <p>
        The first hobby that I have is dancing. I have loved dancing ever since I was a kid, and there are many stories of me going off by myself, turning on the stereo and choreographing random dance routines when I was growing up. Recognizing this, my parents signed me up for a dance lessons in a classical Indian dance form called Kuchipudi. The rest is history, I started when I was 4 years old and I continue practicing and putting on shows to this day. In 2015, I even had a Rangapravesam (often also called an Arangetram) which is a big deal in the dance world. It signifies the dancer's completion of training and readiness to enter the stage as a fully trained performer. Here a few pictures of a photoshoot in preparation for that day:

         A big reason for Kuchipudi being adored world wide is the ability to capture many emotions and display beautiful stories through dance. I thought it would be fun to list a few of my favorite pieces to perform, a brief summary of the story these pieces tell, and links to watch them (random people on YouTube, I don't have any of my own videos posted to the Internet).

	    <tr>
	    <th> Marakatha Mani </th>
	    <th> This is one of my favorite dances to perform because it involves a segment perfomed on a brass plate. The dancer stands on a brass plate, and grips their toes to the edges of the plate to move. Being able to dance on a brass plate takes years of training and extreme attention to details in the beat of the song and body toning. However, when performed it looks almost effortless and is very fun to do. The dance itself describes the appearance and attributes of Lord Krishna. </th>
	    <th> If you are curious to just see the dance on a brass plate, start watching the video around 13:00 <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxxFLI2Ym68"> Link to watch this dance. </a> </th>

	<tr>		
	    <th> Shivastakam </th>
		<th> This well liked piece in Kuchipudi is a fast paces item that uses lots of energy and movement. It is the depiction of Lord Siva's cosmic energy among many attributes. Lord Siva is described as the destoryer of all sins and as one who has the river Ganga flowing from his hair. His omnipresence is celebrated thorugh this dance, and it with its catchy tune, it is one of my favorites to perform. </th >

		<th>Hindolam Thillana</th>
		<th>A thillana is a rhythmic composition in Carnatic music. In a thillana, there are rarely any words sung, it is just a melody of beats and the dancer is a visual embodiment of the rhythm. There is no story to hell here, rather it is Kuchipudi in its purest form. It is a great way to depict the many sequences and movements in Kuchipudi to a beautiful rhythm. This was one of the first dances I learned, and it is a classic that I love to perform.</th>

	<h2 style="color:maroon;"> Cooking and Baking </h2>
	    
	    <p>
	
	As a premedical student, I tend to be extremely busy and can accumulate a lot of stress. Something that always calms me down is either cooking or baking. I prefer cooking over baking because I am a fan of savory foods over sweet foods, but every time I watch the Great British Baking Show I end up getting creative and trying the bake up all sorts of pastries and cakes from around the world. One of my favorite things to bake, and a favorite in my family is baklava. It has a delicate set of flavors, and appears to be tough to make but, it is quite simple at its core. Patience is the key to making baklava, and anyone can make it. I will leave the recipe here, in case you are curious to try making it yourself. 
	</P> 
	
	
		<u> The items that you need to make baklava: </u>

	
	
	<ul> 
		<li>3 cups nuts <i> - I like to use pistachios, almonds, and pecans, but the choice is up to you. I also use a lot of nuts in mine, but you can cut down the quantity if you prefer less nuts  </i> 
		</li>
		<li> 2 sticks <i> - Sounds like a lot, but you need it to make the dough flaky and tasty. This makes around 50 pieces, so think about the butter intake beings spread out over many many pieces </i> 
		</li>
		<li> Frozen phyllo dough <i> - Available at any grocery store!! </i> 
		</li> 
		<li> Honey </li>
		<li> 1 cup sugar </li> 
		<li> cinnamon powder </li>
		<li> nutmeg powder </li> 
		<li> cinnamon stick </li> 
		<li> cloves </li> 
	</ul>
	<u> How to make the baklava: </u>

	<ol> 
		<li> Before beginning, take the phyllo dough out of the freezer and let it thaw completely. It is extremely delicate and must be completely thawed before use or the sheets will break. Also, mae sure not to take the sheets out of the box until you're ready to use or the air will cause the dough to become prematurely brittle </li> 
		<li> Take your nuts, and roughly blend them in a blender. You want the powder to have distinguishable pieces of nuts... not a complete powder</li> 
		<li> Add the sugar, 1 tsp of cinnamon powder, 1 tsp of nutmeg powder to the chopped nuts and mix so that the sugar and spices are well incorporated into the nuts </li>
		<li> Melt the butter </li> 
		<li> Prepare a work station with your rectangle baking dish, butter, nut mixture, dough and a wet cloth within reach. <b> Once you take the dough out, you must work fast, but carefully as extended exposure to air will ruin the dough. When not actively reaching for the dough, make sure to cover it with a wet cloth. </b> Once this station setup has been prepared, you are ready to start assembling </li> 		
		<li> Completely butter the bottom and edges of the baking pan </li> 
		<li> Lay down 5 sheets of phyllo dough at the bottom of the pan and butter generously </li> 
		<li> Spread a handful of nut mixture over the dough, and add 2 sheets at the top and butter. Repeat this process until there are about 5 sheets of dough left. At that final layer, add in all remaining nut mixture and put on the final 5 sheets of dough. Spread all the remaining butter over the top of the dough </li>
		<li> At this point, preheat the oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit </li>
		<li> Carefully, using a long sharp knife, cut the layered baklava into small diamonds. If making the diamonds is too tough, squares is fine </li>
		<li> This next part is a trick I do to make the baklava extra flavorful: add lightly press (if you do it too hard it will be difficult to remove later) a clove into the center of each piece </li>
		<li> Place the baklava into the preheated oven and bake for 45 min, or until the top is golden brown </li> 
		<li> During the last 20 min of baking time, you will start preparing your syrup to pour over the baklava </li>
		<li> Bring about 1.5 cups of water to a boil with a cinnamon stick and about 5 cloves in the water. Then,add in a half cup of honey once the water is actively boiling </li>
		<li> Take the baklava out of the oven, and wait for it to completely cool...usually takes 30 min </li> 
		<li> Transfer the pieces carefully into dish you intend to store the baklava in </li>
			<li> Remove the cloves that you orginally put in the center of the pieces </li>
		<li> pour the cooled syrup all over the baklava pieces, and make sure to cover each piece evenly </li> 
		<li> The baklava is best when it has soaked in syrup overnight, so if you have the resistance, let is soak overnight and enjoy! I usally can't help myself and sample a piece or two before storing it in the pantry overnight </li> 
		
	
		
	</ol> 

	
<p>
	 As you can see, Baklava takes a lot of time and patience to prepare, but the steps are easy and the igredients are natural and simple. Just taking some time to work with my hands and make baklava, takes away all my stress and leaves me with a tasty treat at the end! 
</p>

		I hope you enjoyed reading about two of my favorite things to do! I know it does not seem like a lot, but there are many other things I like to do. I emcee dance shows and parties, dabble into stand up comedy sometimes, work as a tutor, volunteer at the Athens prison to help inmates get thier GED, visit with patients at a hospice, and study!! So, my plate is always full with things to do, but the two activities I talked about here are close to my heart and interesting things about me that many people don't know I like to do. Thanks for your time!!
