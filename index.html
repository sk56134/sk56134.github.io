        <h2> <font color = Maroon> Kuchipudi </font></h2>
        The first hobby that I have is dancing. I have loved dancing ever since I was a kid, and there are many stories of me going off by myself, turning on the stereo and choreographing random dance routines when I was growing up. Recognizing this, my parents signed me up for a dance lessons in a classical Indian dance form called Kuchipudi. The rest is history, I started when I was 4 years old and I continue practicing and putting on shows to this day. In 2015, I even had a Rangapravesam (often also called an Arangetram) which is a big deal in the dance world. It signifies the dancer's completion of training and readiness to enter the stage as a fully trained performer. Here a few pictures of that day:

         A big reason for Kuchipudi being adored world wide is the ability to capture many emotions and display beautiful stories through dance. I thought it would be fun to list a few of my favorite pieces to perform, a brief summary of the story these pieces tell, and links to watch them (random people on YouTube, I don't have any of my own videos posted to the Internet).
