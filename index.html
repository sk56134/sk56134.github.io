        <h2> <font color = Maroon> Kuchipudi </font></h2>
        The first hobby that I have is dancing. I have loved dancing ever since I was a kid, and there are many stories of me going off by myself, turning on the stereo and choreographing random dance routines when I was growing up. Recognizing this, my parents signed me up for a dance lessons in a classical Indian dance form called Kuchipudi. The rest is history, I started when I was 4 years old and I continue practicing and putting on shows to this day. In 2015, I even had a Rangapravesam (often also called an Arangetram) which is a big deal in the dance world. It signifies the dancer's completion of training and readiness to enter the stage as a fully trained performer. Here a few pictures of that day:

         A big reason for Kuchipudi being adored world wide is the ability to capture many emotions and display beautiful stories through dance. I thought it would be fun to list a few of my favorite pieces to perform, a brief summary of the story these pieces tell, and links to watch them (random people on YouTube, I don't have any of my own videos posted to the Internet).

	    <th> Marakatha Mani </th>
	    <th> This is one of my favorite dances to perform because it involves a segment perfomed on a brass plate. The dancer stands on a brass plate, and grips their toes to the edges of the plate to move. Being able to dance on a brass plate takes years of training and extreme attention to details in the beat of the song and body toning. However, when performed it looks almost effortless and is very fun to do. The dance itself describes the appearance and attributes of Lord Krishna. </th>
	    <th> If you are curious to just see the dance on a brass plate, start watching the video around 13:00 <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxxFLI2Ym68"> Link to watch this dance. </a> </th>

	    <th> Shivastakam </th>
		<th> This well liked piece in Kuchipudi is a fast paces item that uses lots of energy and movement. It is the depiction of Lord Siva's cosmic energy among many attributes. Lord Siva is described as the destoryer of all sins and as one who has the river Ganga flowing from his hair. His omnipresence is celebrated thorugh this dance, and it with its catchy tune, it is one of my favorites to perform. </th+>
		<th> <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-rzxRNgrYk"> Link to watch this dance. </a> </th>

		<tr>
		<th>Hindolam Thillana</th>
		<th>A thillana is a rhythmic composition in Carnatic music. In a thillana, there are rarely any words sung, it is just a melody of beats and the dancer is a visual embodiment of the rhythm. There is no story to hell here, rather it is Kuchipudi in its purest form. It is a great way to depict the many sequences and movements in Kuchipudi to a beautiful rhythm. This was one of the first dances I learned, and it is a classic that I love to perform.</th>
